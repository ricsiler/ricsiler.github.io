    <h1>Bio</h1>
	<p>
		When I told my parents that I was going to move from West Virginia to New York, at the ripe old
		age of 33, to pursue my dream of acting, my mother said: ‘You’re going to be a writer.’
		I’m not sure what she based that on because I hadn’t been seriously applying myself as a writer
		up to that point, but my father always said she was ‘witchy’.
		At any rate, I moved to New York and chased my dream: studying with Ed Morehouse at HB
		Studio, doing many showcase productions, the usual. Then I met my wife in one of these
		showcase productions, and we eventually had a child, which put the acting on hold as we took a
		sabbatical to see to raising our daughter. Then I saw an ad in Backstage for auditions for a
		production of The Trip to Bountiful. All the parts were regional and the men were all in my age
		range . . . so I had to do it. Since I had no monologue that was appropriate, I decided to write one
		based on my grandfather, who was a farmer in Kentucky.
		That monologue changed our lives. I was cast in the play. Ellen Burstyn was the lead, and
		through her we found Nyack, NY, where we have lived ever since. I also got into Actors Equity
		through that production. After that experience, my wife said these fateful words to me, ‘See what
		happens when you write?’
		Indeed.
		Since then I have written many full length plays and a few one acts (one of which won some
		awards). About 2008 or 2009, I decided to combine my acting and writing and try my hand at
		solo work; I have written and performed six solo pieces, most recently Like a Sack of Potatoes at
		the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, where I received a four star review!
		My play Where the Rain Never Falls was broadcast on WBAI radio, in New York.
		In 2016 my wife and I performed in Beckett’s Happy Days in the historic Byrdcliffe Theater in
		Woodstock, NY (where I also performed a number of my solo pieces).
		I have been affiliated with several groups over the years, including: Woodstock Fringe
		Playwrights Unit; Theatre Artists Workshop, Supporting Players; Blueberry Pond Writers
		Workshop; Hudson Valley Professional Playwrights Lab; The Genesius Guild; Pulse Ensemble
		and Westchester Collaborative Theater.
		Among my other credits, I was directed by Edward Albee in his play Counting the Ways, and
		appeared in the John Sayles film Matewan.

		Along with Actors Equity, I am a member of the Dramatists Guild and SAG/AFTRA.
