                <p>
                    When I told my parents that I was going to move from West Virginia to New York, at the ripe old
                    age of 33, to pursue my dream of acting, my mother said: 'You're going to be a writer.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not sure what she based that on because I hadn't been seriously applying myself as a writer
                    up to that point, but my father always said she was 'witchy'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At any rate, I moved to New York and chased my dream: studying with Ed Morehouse at HB
                    Studio, doing many showcase productions, the usual. Then I met my wife in one of these
                    showcase productions, and we eventually had a child, which put the acting on hold as we took a
                    sabbatical to see to raising our daughter. Then I saw an ad in Backstage for auditions for a
                    production of <i>The Trip to Bountiful</i>. All the parts were regional and the men were all in my age
                    range, so I had to do it. Since I had no monologue that was appropriate, I decided to write one
                    based on my grandfather, who was a farmer in Kentucky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That monologue changed our lives. I was cast in the play. Ellen Burstyn was the lead, and
                    through her we found Nyack, NY, where we have lived ever since. I also got into Actors Equity
                    through that production. After that experience, my wife said these fateful words to me, 'See what
                    happens when you write?'
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then I have written many full length plays and a few one acts (one of which won some
                    awards). About 2008 or 2009, I decided to combine my acting and writing and try my hand at
                    solo work; I have written and performed six solo pieces, most recently <i>Like a Sack of Potatoes</i> at
                    the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, where I received a four star review!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My play <i>Where the Rain Never Falls</i> was broadcast on WBAI radio, in New York.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2016 my wife and I performed in Beckett's <i>Happy Days</i> in the historic Byrdcliffe Theater in
                    Woodstock, NY (where I also performed a number of my solo pieces).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been affiliated with several groups over the years, including: Woodstock Fringe
                    Playwrights Unit; Theatre Artists Workshop, Supporting Players; Blueberry Pond Writers
                    Workshop; Hudson Valley Professional Playwrights Lab; The Genesius Guild; Pulse Ensemble
                    and Westchester Collaborative Theater.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among my other credits, I was directed by Edward Albee in his play <i>Counting the Ways</i>, and
                    appeared in the John Sayles film <i>Matewan</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with Actors Equity, I am a member of the Dramatists Guild and SAG/AFTRA.

                    <h3>Like a Sack of Potatoes</h3>
                    <div>
                        Frances sits outside his farmhouse and sells baskets of tomatoes he grows, and talks to the people who come to buy them. He grows tobacco and other crops as well. On this day, he tells the story of the relationship with his wife and daughters, which leads, inevitably, to the story of how he dealt with the abusive husband of his oldest daughter.

                        "Masterfully written . . . a character with real depth . . . who nevertheless possesses an intelligence and sensitivity that belies the Hillbilly stereotype"

                    <h3>Old Hickory</h3>
                    <div>
                        Jimmy Hall can only take so much. As he stands there sharpening his favorite knife, Old Hickory, he waits for his ex-wife to show up and tells the story of his life with her, and without her, and why it has come to this moment.

                        “I have a soft spot for one person shows that attempt to expose deeply felt, raw extreme motions and situations of human life. I like it even more when the writer/performer mixes wit with a descriptive power that brings us directly into the place where these emotions live. . . Siler's Southern storytelling voice rings true . . . This is a must see show . . .”
